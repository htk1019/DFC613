## Score : Expressing indicators for evaluating investment attractiveness as a Score

### BoolioScore(fsitem : 1)

The BoolioScore appears to be a comprehensive indicator used to evaluate the attractiveness of an investment. This score seems to incorporate various financial and non-financial factors to represent the attractiveness of a stock numerically. Based on the details provided, the components and characteristics of the BoolioScore can be inferred as follows:

Inclusion of Various Financial Indicators: Traditional financial metrics such as positive cash flow (Positive CFO), a price-to-book ratio (PBR) of less than 1.5, a price-to-earnings ratio (PER) below 15, current assets exceeding long-term liabilities, a debt ratio under 150%, a current ratio above 100%, and a positive average net profit margin over the past three years are included.

Growth and Market Trends Reflection: Factors like positive sales growth over three years, sales growth rate over the past year compared to the recent quarter, an RSI index exceeding 50 relative to the market, and a projected sales trend value of over 0.2 reflect the company's growth and market trends.

Inclusion of Market Performance Indicators: Indicators related to market performance, such as the stock price being within 15% of its 52-week high, recent earnings and sales surprises, and being in the top 20% of RSI values within the industry, are also included.

Other Key Indicators: Ratios like dividend yield, stock price relative to research and development expenses, and price relative to sales are also considered.

Combination of Quantitative and Qualitative Factors: The BoolioScore evaluates a stock's investment attractiveness by mixing quantitative financial data with qualitative factors.

Binary and Floating-Point Data: The score integratively uses binary type conditions (e.g., presence/absence, exceeding or not) and floating-point type indicators (e.g., ratios, volatility).

By synthesizing these elements, the BoolioScore is interpreted as a composite indicator used to assess the overall investment attractiveness of a stock. It seems to provide valuable information for investment decisions by reflecting various financial, market, and operational characteristics of a company.

### Turnaround(fsitem : 61001)

The concept of "Turnaround" in the context of the Piotroski F-Score can be organized into a coherent definition as follows:

**Definition:**
The Turnaround strategy, as delineated by the Piotroski F-Score, is a method developed by Joseph Piotroski, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago. This scoring system evaluates the financial strength of a company by scrutinizing various aspects of its financial statements. The Turnaround aspect focuses on identifying companies that are improving in financial health and are potentially in the process of a positive transformation. The key factors considered in this strategy include:

1. **Cash Flow from Operations Exceeds Net Income**: This indicates that the company's operational activities are generating more cash than what is reported as net income, suggesting efficient operations.

2. **Increase in Total Asset Turnover Ratio from Previous Year**: A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous year demonstrates better utilization of the company's assets.

3. **Positive Cash Flow from Operations**: The company's operational activities generate positive cash flow, signifying good operational health.

4. **Increase in Current Ratio from Previous Year**: An improvement in the current ratio indicates better short-term financial stability.

5. **Increase in Gross Margin (Based on the Most Recent 12 Months of Revenue) from Previous Year**: A rising gross margin shows enhanced profitability and cost efficiency.

6. **Decrease in Long-Term Debt Ratio from Previous Year**: A lower long-term debt ratio suggests improved financial structure and reduced leverage.

7. **No New Shares Issued in the Past Year**: Avoidance of diluting existing shareholders' value through the issuance of additional stock.

8. **Positive Return on Assets (ROA) Based on Recent 12 Months**: Positive ROA indicates effective profitability from the company's assets.

9. **Increase in ROA Compared to the Previous Year**: An increasing ROA suggests growing profitability and operational efficiency.

Overall, the Turnaround strategy as per the Piotroski F-Score identifies companies showing signs of operational and financial improvements, which may indicate a potential for a successful turnaround in their business performance.

### StableValue(fsitem : 61002)

The "StableValue" investment style, based on Graham's value investing philosophy, can be organized into a comprehensive definition as follows:

**Definition:**
The StableValue style, rooted in Graham's value investing philosophy, focuses on identifying and purchasing undervalued stocks that offer a margin of safety. This approach is grounded in the principle of investing in stocks that are priced lower than their intrinsic value, thus providing a buffer against potential market downturns. The key conditions that define the StableValue style are:

1. **Earnings Growth Rate of Over 20% Based on 12-Month Earnings for 3 Years**: This condition ensures that the company has demonstrated a consistent and significant growth in earnings, indicating a stable and growing business.

2. **Price-to-Book Ratio (PBR) of 1.5 or Less**: A low PBR suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to the company's book value, aligning with the value investing criterion of buying below intrinsic value.

3. **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) of 15 or Less**: A lower PER indicates that the stock is priced reasonably relative to its earnings, making it attractive for value investment.

4. **Positive Value of Current Assets Minus Current Liabilities and Long-Term Debt**: This condition checks for financial stability and solvency, ensuring that the company has more current assets than its total short and long-term liabilities.

5. **Debt Ratio of 150% or Less**: A manageable level of debt relative to the company's assets signifies financial prudence and stability.

6. **Current Ratio of 100% or More**: This indicates that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations, a crucial factor for stable value investment.

7. **No Net Loss in Earnings for the Past 3 Years**: Consistent profitability over a three-year period indicates a stable financial performance, a key aspect of Graham's value investing.

In essence, the StableValue style adheres to Graham's investment philosophy by targeting stocks that are not only undervalued but also exhibit financial stability, low debt, and consistent profitability, thereby providing a "margin of safety" for investors.

5. **Annual Net Income Growth Over the Last 3 Years (Year-End Basis)**: Consistent growth in net income indicates financial health and profitability.

6. **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) Between 3 and 60**: This range suggests that the stock is neither overly expensive nor deeply undervalued, fitting into Lynch's balanced approach of growth and value.

7. **Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio Between 0 and 1 (Based on Estimated Future 12-Month Growth)**: A PEG ratio within this range indicates that the stock is undervalued relative to its growth prospects.

8. **Net Cash to Market Capitalization Ratio of Over 30%**: A high ratio suggests strong financial stability and liquidity.

9. **Net Profit Growth Rate Between 0% and 100% for 3 and 5 Years**: This condition ensures that the company's profit growth is sustainable and not excessively high, which could be unsustainable.

10. **Inventory to Sales Growth Rate Below 30%**: Keeping the increase in inventory relative to sales under 30% indicates efficient inventory management and avoids overproduction.

In summary, the PEGrowth style, guided by Peter Lynch's principles, targets companies with a healthy balance of growth potential and value, marked by substantial R&D investment, consistent revenue and profit growth, reasonable valuation metrics, and strong financial stability.

### Deep Value(fsitem : 61004)

The "DeepValue" investment style, following David Dreman's contrarian value investing approach, can be summarized as follows:

**Definition:**
DeepValue, as conceptualized by David Dreman, is a contrarian value investing style that focuses on identifying companies with low market valuations relative to their fundamental worth. This approach often targets stocks that are currently out of favor in the market but have strong underlying financial metrics. The key conditions defining the DeepValue style include:

1. **Current Ratio Over 100%**: This indicates a company's capability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets, signifying liquidity and financial stability.

2. **Debt Ratio Below 40%**: A lower debt ratio represents a more robust financial structure and a conservative approach to leveraging, aligning with the pursuit of strong stability.

3. **BPR (Inverse of PBR) in the Top 20% in the National Stock Market**: High BPR values suggest that the company is significantly undervalued in terms of its book value.

4. **EPR (Inverse of PER) in the Top 20% in the National Stock Market**: A higher EPR indicates that the company is undervalued based on its earnings.

5. **CPR (Inverse of PCR) in the Top 20% in the National Stock Market**: A top-tier CPR score reflects undervaluation based on cash flow metrics.

6. **Dividend Yield in the Top 20% in the National Stock Market**: This highlights companies that offer high dividend yields compared to their market peers, often a sign of undervaluation.

8. **Profit Margin Between 0% and 30% Based on 12-Month Pre-Tax Earnings**: This range ensures profitability without excessively high margins, which could be unsustainable.

9. **Consistent Decline in Debt Ratio Over the Past 3 Years**: A continuous decrease in the debt ratio indicates improving financial health and reduced financial risk.

10. **Return on Assets (ROA) Positive and Below 50**: A positive ROA suggests efficiency in asset utilization, while a value below 50 indicates the stock is not overly expensive based on its asset productivity.

In essence, the DeepValue style adheres to Dreman's principles by focusing on stocks that are fundamentally strong but undervalued by the market, often due to temporary factors or investor sentiment, thus offering potential for significant value appreciation.
